# Joyl Programming Language

**Joyl** is a modern, hybrid programming language designed to combine the simplicity of Python with the speed and memory safety of C and Rust. Joyl is built to be beginner-friendly, yet powerful enough for professional use in areas like web development, embedded systems, AI, games, and scripting.

---

## Features

- **Elegant Syntax**: Clean and readable syntax inspired by Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.
- **High Performance**: Compiles to bytecode and optionally to native machine code.
- **Memory Safety**: Ownership-based memory model inspired by Rust, with no garbage collector.
- **Multi-Paradigm Support**: Procedural, Object-Oriented, Functional.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Includes modules for math, strings, I/O, networking, async, and more.
- **Async/Await**: Modern asynchronous programming made easy.
- **Strong Type System**: Static typing with type inference and optional type annotations.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, Android.
